# Click To Live (But Better)

(▀̿Ĺ̯▀̿ ̿)

This is the repository we will use to collaboratively edit the __Click To Live__ app. When submitting your changes, be sure to make your own branch before you commit
and push. It should prompt you about making a _pull request_, which is exactly what we want.

__DO NOT Commit and Push to the Master Branch and DO NOT edit the Storyboard!__

Storyboard issues are hard to fix and better off if no one touches it all. Don't even move them in the preview.

I'll be the guy to merge everything when everyone submits, that way I can edit things that overlap so everyone's changes are seen (and so nothing breaks).
